great, now i want to create a machine learning model that learns to predict if there is a pass in a sample.

@dataclass
class PositionAndVelocityFeature:
    is_a_pass: bool
    zeroed_position_dominant_foot: List[Position]
    offset_dominant_foot_to_non_dominant_foot: List[Position]
    velocities_dominant_foot: List[Position]
    velocities_non_dominant_foot: List[Position]
An easy way would be to train a NN, but i dont have a lot of data (3000 samples, only 50 contain a "true").

What models are good to learn from sparse data?
